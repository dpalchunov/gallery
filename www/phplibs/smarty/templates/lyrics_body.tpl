            Forgot about the pain,
            Forgot about the future,
            You in the sky again.

            All of your dreams about the sky, [3x]
            And you fly. [2x]

            [Verse 2]
            Believe in love forever,
            Believe in love and now,
            You start to live forever,
            Despite you don't no how.

        For all your life you wanted something better,
        For all your life you wanted something new.
        And every time you wanna make and get it,
        But all your dreams - never coming true.

        [Chorus]
        Thinking of now like it’s the last momentum,
        Thinking about more important things.
        Thinking of now like it’s your last autumn,
        Imagine that world will never see new spring.

        [Verse 2]
        You do not give up, you search for truth and real,
        And years are flying like pendulum swing.
        Please don’t forget about your past and preset,
        The friends you loved, the things you v seen.

            Don't blame yourself it's not your fault.

            How do you feel?
            You can't forget!
            How do you sleep?
            With no one left.
            How do you feel?
            You can't deny,
            With no one left,
            With no one near by.

            [Bridge]
            Living every day, through an awful dreams,
            Every step you made, there is no means.
            Living every day, and that's all,
            You upon your knees with a broken soul.

            [Verse 2]
            Even when you could not stay,
            I plead to god to hear my pray.
            That was the time when hope has gone,
            And now just beeps in telephone.
